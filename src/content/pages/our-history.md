## The Beginning - test!

The Humanists of Greater Portland was founded in 1969 by a group of freethinkers who wanted to create a community for people who valued reason, science, and human welfare over supernatural beliefs.

## Growth and Development

Over the decades, our organization has grown from a small discussion group meeting in members' homes to a vibrant community with regular Sunday programs, social events, and community service projects.

## Today

Today, we continue to provide a welcoming space for atheists, agnostics, secular humanists, and anyone interested in exploring life's big questions from a rational, evidence-based perspective.
