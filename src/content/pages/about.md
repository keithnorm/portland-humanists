## Our Mission

The Humanists of Greater Portland is a community organization dedicated to promoting human well-being, science and reason, secularism, and the values of humanism throughout the Portland metro area.

## What is Humanism?

Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism or other supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.

Humanists ground values in human welfare shaped by human circumstances, interests, and concerns. We are committed to treating each person as having inherent worth and dignity, and to making informed choices in a context of freedom consonant with responsibility.

## Core Principles

Humanists rely on reason and science as the best methods for developing a rational view of the natural universe and our place within it. We believe that:

- **Knowledge of the world** is derived by observation, experimentation, and rational analysis
- **Human progress** is possible through the application of reason and ingenuity to natural and social problems
- **Democratic values** and human rights are essential for a just society
- **Personal fulfillment** emerges from participation in the service of humane ideals
- **Ethical values** are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience
- **Life's fulfillment** emerges from individual participation in the service of humane ideals
- **Working for the common good** is both rational and rewarding

## Our Community

We welcome atheists, agnostics, secular humanists, freethinkers, skeptics, and anyone interested in exploring life's big questions from a rational, evidence-based perspective. Our members come from diverse backgrounds and bring a wealth of perspectives and experiences to our community.

## Sunday Programs

Every Sunday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, we gather at Friendly House in Portland for presentations and discussions. Our programs feature speakers on topics ranging from science and philosophy to ethics and social justice. We also offer Zoom access for those who prefer to participate remotely.

## Get Involved

Whether you're a lifelong humanist or just curious about our philosophy, we invite you to join us. Attend a Sunday program, become a member, or simply connect with us to learn more.
