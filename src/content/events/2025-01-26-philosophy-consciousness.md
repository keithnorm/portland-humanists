Join Dr. Patricia Wong for a fascinating journey into the philosophy of mind and consciousness. This presentation makes complex philosophical concepts accessible to general audiences while respecting the depth of the questions involved.

Topics include:

- The "hard problem" vs. the "easy problems"
- Dualism, physicalism, and alternative frameworks
- What neuroscience tells us (and what it doesn't)
- The explanatory gap and philosophical zombies
- Implications for AI, ethics, and our understanding of ourselves

Whether you're new to philosophy or a seasoned thinker, this presentation will challenge your assumptions and deepen your appreciation for one of humanity's most profound mysteries.
